# CPP3 - C++ STL & operator overloading

## operatorovld.cpp

*Example of operator overloading*

Note that while we only overload the +, <, >, and << operators in this video, those are not the only operators you can overload.  See the C++ information page for a list of operators you can overload.

## vdestruct.cpp

*Demonstrates constructors and destructors get called and why destructors need to be declared virtual*

## vector.cpp

*C++ Vectors*

In general, you should always prefer using the STL classes when you can.  Use vectors - *especially* instead of creating arrays with `new`.

## map.cpp

*C++ Maps*

## algorithm.ccp

*Methods from the C++ algorithms library*

Note that the examples of any_of, any_of, none_of all use lambdas which we haven't covered yet.  For now, just keep in mind that the lambda function is contained between the braces, so you can update that part to have it do what you want.
