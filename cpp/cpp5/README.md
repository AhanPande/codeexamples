*Demonstrates in which situations the constructor, destructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, and move assignment operator methods get called."

The purpose of this video is to demonstrate *when* the methods get called, **not how to write the methods**.  Note that in practice you would only want to write these methods if necessary (Rule of 5).  The class we start with technically doesn't need any of these methods (Rule of Zero).
