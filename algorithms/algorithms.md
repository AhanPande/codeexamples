## Examples

- A great collection of data structures & algorithms from the *Grokking Algorithms* book implemented in several languages is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms)

## Big-Oh Notation

- [A Beginner's Guide to Big-Oh Notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
- [Big-Oh: How Code Slows as Data Grows](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/slowsgrows.html) has examples in Python, but a good overview

## Advanced Practice Problems

The problems listed here are *well* beyond what I will expect you to do in this class, but you should have the ability by the end of the course to complete them.  They make great practice for coding interviews.

- [The Great Tree-List Recursion Problem](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/109/TreeListRecursion.html) is a challenging practice problem that uses trees & doubly linked lists.

## Interesting links

- [The Case for Learned Index Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01208) describes a method for using artificial intelligence techniques to learn a more efficient index.
