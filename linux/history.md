## Source Code

- [A COMMENTARY ON THE SIXTH EDITION UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM[()] (includes source code)
- [Old UNIX source code](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/) - I haven't looked around too much, but there are some C files that implement several UNIX commands.
- ["Dissecting linux kernel code" or "That syscall shouldn't give that error code!"](https://finnoleary.net/kernel-code.html)

## Commands

The links here are for informational purposes only.  I don't necessarily agree with the point of view of every article.

- [The Year 2038 Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem)
- [Revisiting the “Unix Philosophy” in 2018](https://opensource.com/article/18/11/revisiting-unix-philosophy-2018) talks about some old ideas from Unix that are still relevant today.
- Does UNIX live up to the UNIX philosophy?  Maybe [Unix is not an acceptable Unix](http://mkremins.github.io/blog/unix-not-acceptable-unix/).

## Humor

Unix was a prank by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan
